## What is Rocket Help?

Rocket Help is an application for managing IT "calls". The app is ideal for keep tracking of equipment with problems and the solutions to those problems.

It was developed during the [Rocketseat](https://www.rocketseat.com.br/) Ignite Lab event.

<br>

> The app itself is pretty much the same that is created at the videos. However, I put my own "code style" in it, coding like I usually do and improving it as I could (e.g. React Hook Form and Yup for the form management and validations, Context API for global authentication state, some other design issues, etc).
